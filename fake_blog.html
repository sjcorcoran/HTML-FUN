        <h1 class="a"> The untold story of Chester, the Cheeto Cheetah</h1>

        <p class="highlight"> In the beginning, there were thousands, if not millions of different types of cheese
            cheetahs. These times
            are often notated as B.C when talking in tearms of timelines. Some believe this to mean
            before christ, but this is an erro. B.C means "Before Cheese"</p>

    <h3 class="f"> I was born in the year Before Cheese 2006. this was just after the invention of the toaster strudel
        and the
        wheel. Little did I know, I would soon be the last of my kind. At the time, we existed with humans peacefully,
        until they learned of our delicous flavor and tubular attitudes.
        The Cheese wars soon broke out, and we fell to the humans. Only I was spared, because I was super cheesy. Soon I
        started the Frito lay company... I think. Now I am the <span>most powerful Cheetah</span> to have ever lived.
